SETTING UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT:
===========================
1. Download VirtualBox and Vagrant from the following URLs:
	https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
	https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2. Create a folder and name it "ChoreoProDev." You can put this folder anywhere you like. 
3. Add the Vagrantfile and shell script to this folder.
4. Inside the ChoreoProDev folder, create two more folders named "www" and "data."
5. Now open your command prompt and navigate to the ChoreoProDev Directory. Enter the following command:
	vagrant up
6. After this is complete, run the following command:
	vagrant ssh
7. If that command does not work, try running the following:
	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin
8. Once the vagrant ssh command is working, run the following commands:
	sudo apt-get install lamp-server^
	sudo apt-get install git
9. Navigate to /var/www
10. Run the following command:
	git clone -b dev https://github.com/aakashpatel1/ChoreoProSite.git
11. Now run the following URL in your web browser:
	http://127.0.0.1:4567/ChoreoProSite
12. You will get a confirmation that you have successfully configured your dev environment. Happy coding!
